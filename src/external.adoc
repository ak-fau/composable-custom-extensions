= External Specifications

This section contains changes to external specifications for RISC-V
Composable Custom Extensions.  It is intended that as these sections
are incorporated into the upstream specification or similar, they will
be removed from this document.  External specifications include both
RISC-V and non-RISC-V specifications and other information
specification mechanisms.

=== Unified Discovery

[NOTE]
====
This section will be incorporated into the RISC-V Unified Discovery
Specification, as appropriate.
====

[TIP]
====
Add schema for identifying composable custom extension on harts and
any necessary parameters, such as state size.

If necessary add schema for identifying multiple CX instances and
heterogeneous per-hart accessibility of these CX instances.
====

=== Devicetree

[TIP]
====
Add schema for attributes that identify composable custom extension on
harts and any necessary parameters, such as state size.

If necessary add schema for identifying multiple CX instances and
heterogeneous per-hart accessibility of these CX instances.
====

=== ACPI

[NOTE]
====
This section will be incorporated into the ACPI Specification.
====

[TIP]
====
Add definition for ACPI table for identifying composable custom
extension on harts and any necessary parameters, such as state size.

If necessary add support for identifying multiple CX instances and
heterogeneous per-hart accessibility of these CX instances.
====


=== User Space ABI

[NOTE]
====
This section will be incorporated into the RISC-V psABI Specification.
====

==== Composable Custom Extension Aware Calling Convention

[TIP]
====
Define a calling convention for handling composable custom extension
framework state on calls between object files that both support this
convention.

Define criteria for use by composable custom extension authors in
defining extension specific calling conventions that support similar
behavior.
====

==== Legacy Interoperability Calling Convention

[TIP]
====
Define calling conventions for handling composable custom extension
framework state on calls between object files that support composable
custom extensions (as defined in spec-abi-cx) and those that do not.

Define criteria for use by composable custom extension authors in
defining extension specific calling conventions that support similar
behavior.
====

=== User Space API

[TIP]
====
Specify an API that provides a uniform CX programming model including
CX naming, discovery, versioning, CX selection, and error handling and
correct composition of CX libraries.

If necessary the API will support both the singleton CX model and the
multiple CX instance model.
====

=== SBI

[NOTE]
====
This section will be incorporated into the RISC-V SBI Specification.
====

[TIP]
====
It is unclear if an SBI extension is necessary.  It will be specified
as needed.
====

=== Linux

[TIP]
====
Add interfaces to `hwprobe`, `prctl`, and `sysfs` to provide discovery of
composable custom extensions and related parameters and control of
extension enablement.

If necessary add additional interfaces or syscalls to support a multiple
CX instance model.
