== Privileged Opcode and State Multiplexing

[TIP]
====
Specify an ISA extension for more privileged code to grant access to a
CX to less privileged code, and to enable privileged code to trap and
emulate CX instructions/CSRs.

If necessary the ISA extension also supports access control to
multiple CX instances of the same CX.
