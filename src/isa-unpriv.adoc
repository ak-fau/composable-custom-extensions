== Unprivileged Opcode and State Multiplexing

[TIP]
====
Specify an ISA extension to select the current CX to perform custom
instructions/CSRs, and to indicate multiplexing status/errors.

If necessary the ISA extension supports selection of one of possibly
multiple CX instances of the same CX.

If necessary the ISA extension also supports selection of a current CX
(or CX instance) for each of multiple subranges of custom
instructions/CSRs.
